### Description

Budget Tracker is an application that allows you to keep track of earning and spending, even when a user doesn't have internet access (traveling, power outage, moving, etc.)

### Usage

The user will be presented with a form to fill out, which includes transaction name, amount, and a choice to add or subtract funds based upon that transaction. When the user has entered the necessary information, a graph below will be updated to reflect the users' transaction history.
